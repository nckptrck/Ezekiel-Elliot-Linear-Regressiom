This project attempts to predict Ezekiel Elliots yards per carry based on his total amount of career touches (rushing attempts and receptions) from 2016-2022. 

All data was scraped from pro-football-refrence.com, combined and cleaned by myself. Regular season data is labeled 'Zeke-RS.csv', and playoff data is labeled 'Zeke-Playoffs.csv'

R packages used include tidyverse (cleaning/ visualizing data), readxl and here (reading csv files in), knitr, broom, and kableExtra (creating tables).
